# Use Visual Search

Adobe Experience Manager Assets integrates with Adobe Sensei with Visual Search, allowing marketers to search for image assets in Experience Manager that are visually similar to a selected asset. This is a great way to discover new images, or even, just a quick, simple way to find alternatives to a selected asset.
