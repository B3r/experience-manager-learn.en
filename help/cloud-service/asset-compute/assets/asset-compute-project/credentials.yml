    If this was generated by Adobe I/O, it is in the auto-downloaded config.zip > private.key.
    If you provided the public key to Adobe I/O, then you should also be in possesion of the matching private key.

    If you do not have these key pairs, you can generate new keypairs or upload new public keys at the bottom of:
    console.adobe.io > Your Asset Compute Firefly project > Workspaces @ Development > Service Account (JWT)
