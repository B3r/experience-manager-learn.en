## Asset Compute Local Dev Tool

The Asset Compute Local Dev Tool is a web-harness that allows developers to configure and execute Asset Computer workers locally, outside the context of the AEM SDK against the Asset Compute resources in Adobe Runtime.

###  Start the Asset Compute Local Dev Tool

The Asset Compute Local Dev tool can be run from the root of the Asset Compute application project via the terminal command:

```
$ aio app run
```

This will start the Asset Compute Dev Tool at localhost port 9000, and automatically load it in a browser window. For the Asset Compute Dev Tool to run, [a valid, auto-generated devToolToken must be provided via a query parameter](#troubleshooting__devtooltoken).

### Understand the Asset Compute Dev Tools interface

![Asset Compute Dev Tool]()

1. __Source file:__ The source file selection is used to upload example source files that can be selected via the dropdown and used as the payload for Asset Compute workers during development.
1. __Asset Compute profile definition:__ Defines the Asset Compute profile to run, including the worker's URL end-point, the resultant rendition name, and any parameters.
1. __Run:__ The Run button executes the Asset Compute profile as defined in the Asset Compute configuration profile editor.
1. __Abort:__ The Abort button cancels an execution initiated from tapping the Run button.
1. __Request/Response:__ Provides the HTTP request and response to/from the Asset Compute application running in Adobe Runtime. This can be helpful for debugging.
1. __Activation Logs:__ The logs describing the Asset Compute application's execution, along with any errors. This information is aslo available in the `aio app run` standard out.
1. __Renditions:__ Displays all renditions generated by the execution of th Asset Compute application.

### Use the Asset Compute Dev Tool

1. Ensure the Asset Compute Dev Tool via `aio app run` from your Asset Compute application's root folder.
1. Upload a [test asset](assets/asset-compute-dev-tool/test-image.jpeg) as a source asset.
1. Review the the Asset Compute profile defintion's JSON definition, notice the `worker` key points to our Development workspace's project.
1. Tap the Run button
1. Review the generated renditions to ensure the computed renditions are correct and as expected.


## Troubleshooting

## Adobe I/O authentication expiration{#troubleshooting__expired-credentials}}

```
$ aio login
```

Opens Web browser and prompts for Adobe credentials.


## Invalid Adobe I/O authentication credentials{#troubleshooting__invalid-credentials}

```
$ aio logout
You have successfully logged out.
$ aio login
```

Opens Web browser and prompts for Adobe credentials.


## Source files dropdown incorrect{#troubleshooting__dev-tool-application-cache}

Asset Compute Dev Tool may enter a state where it pulls stale data, and is most noticable in the 
Source file dropdown, which might display old files or not display 

+ __Error:__ Source file dropdown displays incorrect items.
+ __Cause:__ Stale cached browser state causes the 
+ __Resolution:__ In your browser completely clear the browser tab's application state, the browser cache, local storage and service worker.

## Missing devToolToken query parameter{#troubleshooting__devtooltoken}

For the Asset Compute Dev Tool to properly work, it MUST have a valid `devToolToken` query parameter, which is automatically generated and added when the Web browser window is spawned.
