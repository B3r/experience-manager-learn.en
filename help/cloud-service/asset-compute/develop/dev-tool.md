## Asset Compute Local Dev Tool

The Asset Compute Local Dev Tool is a web-harness that allows developers to configure and execute Asset Computer workers locally, outside the context of the AEM SDK against the Asset Compute resources in Adobe Runtime.

###  Start the Asset Compute Local Dev Tool

The Asset Compute Local Dev tool can be run from the root of the Asset Compute application project via the terminal command:

```
$ aio app run
```

This will start the Asset Compute Dev Tool at localhost port 9000, and automatically load it in a browser window. For the Asset Compute Dev Tool to run, [a valid, auto-generated devToolToken must be provided via a query parameter](#troubleshooting__devtooltoken).

### Understand the Asset Compute Dev Tools interface{#interface}

![Asset Compute Dev Tool]()

1. __Source file:__ The source file selection is used to upload example source files that can be selected via the dropdown and used as the payload for Asset Compute workers during development.
1. __Asset Compute profile definition:__ Defines the Asset Compute profile to run, including the worker's URL end-point, the resultant rendition name, and any parameters.
1. __Run:__ The Run button executes the Asset Compute profile as defined in the Asset Compute configuration profile editor.
1. __Abort:__ The Abort button cancels an execution initiated from tapping the Run button.
1. __Request/Response:__ Provides the HTTP request and response to/from the Asset Compute application running in Adobe Runtime. This can be helpful for debugging.
1. __Activation Logs:__ The logs describing the Asset Compute application's execution, along with any errors. This information is aslo available in the `aio app run` standard out.
1. __Renditions:__ Displays all renditions generated by the execution of th Asset Compute application.

### Invoke the worker from Dev Tool

1. Ensure Asset Compute Dev Tool is started from your project root using the `aio app run` command.
1. In the Asset Compute Dev Tool, upload the [sample file](assets/sample.jpg), and ensure it is selected in the __Source file__ dropdown.
1. Review the __Asset Compute profile definition__ text area.
    + The `worker` key provides a URL to the deploys Asset Compute worker.
    + The `name` key provides the name of the rendition to generate.
    + Other key/values can be provied in this JSON object, and will be availabe in the worker under the `rendition.instructions` object.
1. Tap the __Run__ button.
1. The __Renditions section__ will populate with a rendition place holder.
1. Once the worker completes, the rendition placeholder will display the generated rendition.

Making code changes to the worker while Dev Tool is running will "hot deploy" the changes. The "hot deploy" takes several seconds so do not 

## Troubleshooting

## Adobe I/O authentication expiration{#troubleshooting__expired-credentials}

```
$ aio login
```

Opens Web browser and prompts for Adobe credentials. Ensure you successfully authenticate using and Adobe ID with access to the Adobe I/O FireFly project.

## Invalid Adobe I/O authentication credentials{#troubleshooting__invalid-credentials}

```
$ aio logout
You have successfully logged out.
$ aio login
```

Opens Web browser and prompts for Adobe credentials. Ensure you successfully authenticate using and Adobe ID with access to the Adobe I/O FireFly project.

## Source files dropdown incorrect{#troubleshooting__dev-tool-application-cache}

Asset Compute Dev Tool may enter a state where it pulls stale data, and is most noticable in the 
Source file dropdown, which might display old files or not display 

+ __Error:__ Source file dropdown displays incorrect items.
+ __Cause:__ Stale cached browser state causes the 
+ __Resolution:__ In your browser completely clear the browser tab's application state, the browser cache, local storage and service worker.

## Missing devToolToken query parameter{#troubleshooting__devtooltoken}

For the Asset Compute Dev Tool to properly work, it MUST have a valid `devToolToken` query parameter, which is automatically generated and added when the Web browser window is spawned.
