## Asset Compute Local Dev Tool

The Asset Compute Local Dev Tool is a web-harness that allows developers to configure and execute Asset Computer workers locally, outside the context of the AEM SDK against the Asset Compute resources in Adobe Runtime.

###  Starting the Asset Compute Local Dev Tool

The Asset Compute Local Dev tool can be run from the root of the Asset Compute application project via the terminal command:

```
$ aio app run
```

This will start the Asset Compute Dev Tool at localhost port 9000, and automatically load it in a browser window. For the Asset Compute Dev Tool to run, [a valid, auto-generated devToolToken must be provided via a query parameter](#troubleshooting__devtooltoken).

### Understanding the Asset Compute Dev Tools interface

![Asset Compute Dev Tool]()

1. __Source file:__ The source file selection is used to upload example source files that can be selected via the dropdown and used as the payload for Asset Compute workers during development.
1. __Asset Compute profile definition:__ Defines the Asset Compute profile to run, including the worker's URL end-point, the resultant rendition name, and any parameters.
1. __Run:__ The Run button executes the Asset Compute profile as defined in the Asset Compute configuration profile editor.
1. __Abort:__ The Abort button cancels an execution initiated from tapping the Run button.
1. __Request/Response:__ Provides the HTTP request and response to/from the Asset Compute application running in Adobe Runtime. This can be helpful for debugging.
1. __Activation Logs:__ The logs describing the Asset Compute application's execution, along with any errors. This information is aslo available in the `aio app run` standard out.
1. __Renditions:__ Displays all renditions generated by the execution of th Asset Compute application.

### Using the Asset Compute Dev Tool


1. Ensure the Asset Compute Dev Tool via `aio app run` from your Asset Compute application's root folder.
1. Upload a test asset.
1. Configure the Asset Compute profile defintion's JSON definition as needed.'
1. Tap the Run button
1. Review the generated renditions to ensure the computed renditions are correct and as expected.


## Troubleshooting

## Adobe I/O authentication expiration{#troubleshooting__expired-credentials}}

```
$ aio login
```

Opens Web browser and prompts for Adobe credentials.


## Invalid Adobe I/O authentication credentials{#troubleshooting__invalid-credentials}

```
$ aio logout
You have successfully logged out.
$ aio login
```

Opens Web browser and prompts for Adobe credentials.


## Missing devToolToken query parameter{#troubleshooting__devtooltoken}



For the Asset Compute Dev Tool to properly work, it MUST have a valid `devToolToken` query parameter, which is automatically generated and added when the Web browser window is spawned.
